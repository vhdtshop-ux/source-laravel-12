# Website Refactor Plan

## Purpose

This document is the canonical staged refactor roadmap for `Modules/Website`.

The Website module will be improved in controlled phases. Each phase must be analyzed, implemented, tested, and approved before moving to the next phase.

Application source must not be changed outside the active phase scope.

# Phase 0 — Baseline & Safety Net

## Goal

Create a reliable baseline of current Website behavior before code changes.

## Status

- [x] ANALYZED
- [x] IMPLEMENTED — documentation/baseline artifacts completed
- [x] TESTED
- [x] APPROVED
- Decision: `CLOSED`

## Exit Evidence

- Static Website inventory completed.
- Routes/controllers/Livewire/services/models/database reviewed.
- Cross-module and database debt recorded.
- Known pre-refactor defects registered in `PHASE_0_BASELINE.md`.
- `WebsiteRouteConfigurationTest`: `PASS — 3 tests / 30 assertions`.
- Full repository suite executed: `44 failed / 51 passed`; unrelated repository-wide debt recorded rather than attributed to Website.
- Frontend manual smoke test: `PASS` (user verified).
- Admin/backend manual smoke test: `PASS` (user verified).
- No additional manual runtime defects reported.

Canonical Phase 0 evidence:

- `docs/modules/Website/PHASE_0_BASELINE.md`
- `docs/modules/Website/PHASE_0_SMOKE_TEST.md`

The working frontend/admin behavior observed in Phase 0 is now the regression baseline for all later phases.

---

# Phase 1 — Stabilize & Security

## Goal

Fix current high-risk correctness/security defects before architectural migration or UI rebuilding.

## Status

- [x] ANALYZED
- [x] IMPLEMENTED
- [x] TESTED
- [x] APPROVED
- Active sub-phase: `None — Phase 1 closed`

## Phase 1A — Checkout Stabilization

### Scope

Only checkout/payment correctness and the focused tests required to protect those changes. Do not perform Phase 2 domain migration, Phase 3 database redesign, or UI redesign in Phase 1A.

### Checklist

- [ ] Re-inspect checkout routes, controller, Livewire checkout flow, CheckoutService, CartService, Order/OrderItem/OrderHistory usage, Coupon usage, product stock mutation, and payment configuration.
- [ ] Resolve broken MoMo callback contract.
- [ ] Ensure callback maps to a real controller/service flow.
- [ ] Verify payment callback/signature server-side when MoMo is an active supported payment method; otherwise explicitly disable/remove the broken public contract rather than leaving a dead route.
- [ ] Move final stock verification inside transaction.
- [ ] Lock product/inventory rows before final stock check.
- [ ] Prevent overselling.
- [ ] Make order creation atomic.
- [ ] Make coupon usage atomic.
- [ ] Remove save-after-cart-delete defect.
- [ ] Prevent duplicate orders/double submit.
- [ ] Define retry/idempotency behavior appropriate to the current schema/contracts.
- [ ] Preserve existing working COD behavior.
- [ ] Add focused checkout regression tests before/together with risky changes.
- [ ] Do not rewrite legacy migrations in this phase.

### Phase 1A Test Gate

- [ ] normal COD checkout
- [ ] empty cart
- [ ] inactive product
- [ ] insufficient stock
- [ ] concurrent checkout with stock=1
- [ ] valid coupon
- [ ] invalid/expired coupon
- [ ] double submit
- [ ] valid payment callback when MoMo is supported
- [ ] tampered callback when MoMo is supported
- [ ] duplicate callback when MoMo is supported
- [ ] rollback consistency
- [ ] Phase 0 Website route regression test remains green
- [ ] frontend/admin Phase 0 smoke baseline remains intact

### Phase 1A Approval Gate

Do not start Phase 1B until Phase 1A implementation has been tested and explicitly approved by the user.

## Phase 1B — Admin Authorization

- [ ] Define capability permission matrix.
- [ ] Keep `auth:admin`.
- [ ] Add named capability checks.
- [ ] Homepage mutation authorization.
- [ ] Header/menu mutation authorization.
- [ ] Footer mutation authorization.
- [ ] Banner mutation authorization.
- [ ] Coupon mutation authorization.
- [ ] Flash-sale mutation authorization.
- [ ] Customer mutation authorization.
- [ ] Affiliate mutation authorization.
- [ ] Authorize inside sensitive Livewire methods.
- [ ] Add allowed/denied tests.

Suggested capability direction:

```text
website.view
website.home.manage
website.menu.manage
website.banner.manage
website.footer.manage
website.settings.manage
website.seo.manage
```

Other domains should eventually own their own capabilities, such as customer, marketing, and affiliate permissions.

## Phase 1C — Settings, Script Security, Cache

- [x] Centralize production Website settings mutations.
- [x] Fix cache invalidation consistency.
- [x] Remove direct DB/model queries from frontend Blade.
- [x] Restrict custom script editing to privileged capability.
- [x] Review raw HTML/script rendering.
- [x] Validate image upload MIME/extension/size.
- [x] Define old-file cleanup policy.
- [x] Add settings/cache/security tests (runtime DB checks require PDO SQLite).

Phase 1C implementation evidence: `docs/modules/Website/PHASE_1C_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Phase 1 Approval Gate

Do not enter Phase 2 until:

- checkout tests pass;
- authorization tests pass;
- settings/cache tests pass;
- Phase 0 working behavior remains intact except explicitly repaired baseline defects;
- user explicitly approves Phase 1.

Evaluate/standardize around services such as:

- `WebsiteSettingsService`
- `HomepageService`
- `WebsitePageService`
- `NavigationService`
- `BannerService`
- `FooterService`
- `SeoService`

Use canonical domain services for Product, Category, Post, Order, User/Account instead of recreating those workflows in Website.

- [ ] Blade contains no database queries
- [ ] Livewire contains no direct business persistence
- [ ] remove direct `DB::table()` usage from Website Livewire

- [ ] authorization boundaries are explicit
- [ ] cache invalidation is centralized
- [ ] return shapes are documented/typed where practical

## Target Public Flow

```text
Route
-> Controller
-> Website Service
-> canonical domain services

- [x] audit dead controllers — no additional zero-caller controller found
- [x] audit dead views — prior compatibility views removed
- [x] audit dead routes — route cache and route contract pass
- [ ] remove legacy homepage settings keys — DEFERRED, active compatibility caller remains
- [ ] remove obsolete columns/tables — DEFERRED until zero-caller proof and rollback window

## Release Verification

# Stage-Gate Working Rule

For every phase:

```text
ANALYZE
   ↓
LOCK CHECKLIST
   ↓
IMPLEMENT ONLY ACTIVE PHASE
   ↓
TEST
   ↓
REPORT PASS / FAIL / REMAINING
   ↓
USER APPROVAL
   ↓
NEXT PHASE
```

Rules:

1. Do not silently move into another phase.
2. Do not delete legacy code before callers migrate and tests pass.
3. Do not redesign database during an unrelated phase.
4. Do not treat an old baseline defect as a new refactor regression.
5. Preserve backward compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
6. When a phase fails its gate, fix that phase before proceeding.
